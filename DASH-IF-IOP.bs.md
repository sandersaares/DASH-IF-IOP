# Timing and addressing # {#timing}

This section describes an interoperable view of DASH presentation timing and segment addressing. This interpretation is considerably narrower than afforded by [[MPEGDASH]], constraining services to a specific set of reasonably flexible behaviors that are highly interoperable with modern client platforms. Services conforming to this document SHALL use this timing model.

The presentation manifest or MPD defines the <dfn>MPD timeline</dfn> which serves as the baseline for all scheduling decisions made during DASH presentation playback.

The playback of a static MPD SHALL NOT depend on the mapping of the MPD timeline to real time meaning all media resources required for playing any part of this presentation become available to the client at the same time.

The MPD timeline of a dynamic MPD SHALL have a fixed mapping to real time, with each point on the timeline corresponding to a point in real time. Clients MAY introduce an additional offset with respect to real time [[#timing-timeshift|to the extent allowed by the time shift signaling in the MPD]].

Note: In addition to mapping the content to real time, [[#timing-mpd-updates|a dynamic MPD can be updated during the presentation]]. Updates may add new periods and remove or modify existing ones, though some restrictions apply. See [[#timing-mpd-updates]].

The  <dfn>zero point</dfn> in the MPD timeline of a dynamic MPD SHALL be mapped to the point in real time indicated by `MPD@availabilityStartTime`. This value SHALL NOT change between MPD updates.

The ultimate purpose of the MPD is to enable the client to obtain media samples for playback. The following data structures are most relevant to locating and scheduling the samples:

1. The MPD consists of consecutive [=periods=] which map data onto the MPD timeline.
1. Each period contains of one or more [=representations=], each of which provides media samples inside a sequence of [=media segments=].
1. Representations within a period are grouped in [=adaptation sets=], which associate related representations and decorate them with metadata.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/BasicMpdElements.png" />
	<figcaption>The primary elements described by an MPD.</figcaption>
</figure>

The chapters below explore these relationships in detail.

## Periods ## {#timing-period}

An MPD SHALL define an ordered list of one or more <dfn title="period">periods</dfn>. A period is both a time span on the [=MPD timeline=] and a definition of the data to be presented during the period. Period timing is relative to the [=zero point=] of the [=MPD timeline=].

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/PeriodsMakeTheMpd.png" />
	<figcaption>An MPD is a collection of periods, starting from a zero point and with a total duration (which may be unlimited for live services).</figcaption>
</figure>

Common reasons for defining multiple periods are:

* Assembling a presentation from multiple self-contained pieces of content.
* Inserting ads in the middle of existing content and/or replacing spans of existing content with ads.
* Adding/removing certain representations as the nature of the content changes (e.g. a new title starts with a different set of offered languages).
* Updating period-scoped metadata (e.g. codec configuration or DRM signaling).

Periods are self-contained - a service SHALL NOT require a client to know the contents of another period in order to correctly present a period. Knowledge of the contents of different periods MAY be used by a client to achieve seamless period transitions, especially when working with [[#timing-connectivity|period-connected representations]].

All periods SHALL be consecutive and non-overlapping. A period MAY have a duration of zero.

Note: A period with a duration of zero might, for example, be the result of ad-insertion logic deciding not to insert any ad.

<div class="example">
The below MPD example consists of two 20-second periods. The duration of the first period is calculated using the start point of the second period. The total duration is also listed, as it is required for static MPDs.

<xmp highlight="xml">
<MPD xmlns="urn:mpeg:dash:schema:mpd:2011" type="static" mediaPresentationDuration="PT40S">
	<Period>
		...
	</Period>
	<Period start="PT20S" duration="PT20S">
		...
	</Period>
</MPD>
</xmp>

Parts of the MPD structure that are not relevant for this chapter have been omitted - this is not a fully functional MPD file.
</div>

In a static MPD, the first period SHALL start at the [=zero point=] of the [=MPD timeline=]. In a dynamic MPD, the first period SHALL start at or after the [=zero point=] of the [=MPD timeline=].

In a static MPD, the last period SHALL have a `Period@duration`. In a dynamic MPD, the last period MAY have a `Period@duration`, in which case it is considered to have a fixed duration. If without `Period@duration`, the last period in a dynamic MPD SHALL be considered to have an unlimited duration.

Note: In a dynamic MPD, a period with an unlimited duration may be converted to fixed-duration by an MPD update. Periods in a dynamic MPD may also be shortened or removed entirely under certain conditions. See [[#timing-mpd-updates]].

In a static MPD, `MPD@mediaPresentationDuration` SHALL be present.

In a dynamic MPD, `MPD@mediaPresentationDuration` SHALL be present if the following conditions are true and SHALL NOT be present otherwise:

1. The last period has a `Period@duration`.
1. No new periods will be added to the MPD in the future.

When present, `MPD@mediaPresentationDuration` SHALL accurately indicate the duration between the [=zero point=] on the [=MPD timeline=] and the end of the last [=period=].

## Representations ## {#timing-representation}

A <dfn>representation</dfn> is a sequence of <dfn>segment references</dfn> and a description of the samples within the referenced [=media segments=]. Each representation belongs to exactly one [=adaptation set=] and to exactly one [=period=], although [[#timing-connectivity|a representation may be connected with a representation in another period]].

Each segment reference addresses a [=media segment=] that corresponds to a specific time span on the [=sample timeline=]. Each [=media segment=] contains samples for a specific time span on the [=sample timeline=].

Note: [=Simple addressing=] allows the actual time span of samples within a [=media segment=] to deviate from the nominal time span described in the MPD. All timing-related clauses in this document refer to the nominal timing described in the MPD unless otherwise noted.

The exact mechanism used to define segment references depends on the [=addressing mode=] used by the representation. All representations in the same [=adaptation set=] SHALL use the same [=addressing mode=].

In a static MPD, a representation SHALL contain enough [=segment references=] to cover the entire time span of the [=period=].

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/StaticMpdMustBeCovered.png" />
	<figcaption>In a static MPD, the entire period must be covered with [=media segments=].</figcaption>
</figure>

In a dynamic MPD, a representation SHALL contain enough segment references to cover the time span of the [=period=] that intersects with the [=time shift window=].

Note: Enough segment references must exist to cover the entire [=time shift window=]. Meanwhile, [=media segments=] become [=available=] when their end point is within the [=availability window=]. It is a valid situation that a [=media segment=] is required to be referenced but is not yet [=available=].

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/MandatorySegmentReferencesInDynamicMpd.png" />
	<figcaption>In a dynamic MPD, the [=time shift window=] determines the set of required segment references. [=Media segments=] filled with gray need not be referenced due to falling outside the [=time shift window=], despite falling within the bounds of a [=period=].</figcaption>
</figure>

Advisement: A dynamic MPD must remain valid for its entire validity duration after publishing. In other words, a dynamic MPD SHALL supply enough segment references to allow the [=time shift window=] to extend by the MPD validity duration defined by `MPD@minimumUpdatePeriod`.

An unnecessary segment reference is one that is not defined as required by this chapter.

In a static MPD, a representation SHALL NOT contain unnecessary segment references, except when using [=indexed addressing=] in which case such segment references MAY be present.

In a dynamic MPD, a representation SHALL NOT contain unnecessary segment references, except when any of the following applies to a segment reference:

1. The segment reference is for future content and will eventually become necessary.
1. The segment reference is defined via [=indexed addressing=].
1. Removal of the segment reference is not allowed by [[#timing-mpd-updates-remove-content|content removal constraints]].

There SHALL NOT be gaps or overlapping [=media segments=] in a representation.

Clients SHALL NOT present any samples from [=media segments=] that are entirely outside the [=period=], even if such [=media segments=] are referenced.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/SamplesOnPeriodBoundary.png" />
	<figcaption>[=Media segments=] and samples need not align with [=period=] boundaries. Some samples may be entirely outside a [=period=] (marked gray) and some may overlap the [=period=] boundary (yellow).</figcaption>
</figure>

The earliest/latest sample of a [=Media segment=] MAY be unaligned with (i.e. starts earlier/ends later than) the start/end point of a [=period=] except when using [=simple addressing=], which requires the first [=media segment=] start point to match the [=period=] start point.

Note: Despite constraints on first [=media segment=] alignment, [=simple addressing=] allows the media samples within the first [=media segment=] to be unaligned with the [=period=] start point, allowing for synchronization of different reprensetations.

If a [=media segment=] overlaps a [=period=] boundary, clients SHOULD NOT present the samples that lie outside the [=period=] and SHOULD present the samples that lie either partially or entirely within the [=period=].

Note: In the end, which samples are presented is entirely up to the client. It may sometimes be impractical to present [=media segments=] only partially, depending on the capabilties of the client platform, the type of media samples involved and any dependencies between samples.

## Sample timeline ## {#timing-sampletimeline}

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/TimelineAlignment.png" />
	<figcaption>Sample timelines are mapped onto the [=MPD timeline=] based on parameters defined in the MPD.</figcaption>
</figure>

The samples within a [=representation=] exist on a linear <dfn>sample timeline</dfn> defined by the encoder that created the samples. One or more sample timelines are mapped onto the [=MPD timeline=] by metadata stored in or referenced by the MPD.

Note: A sample timeline is linear - encoders are expected to use an appropriate timescale and sufficiently large timestamp fields to avoid any wrap-around. If wrap-around does occur, a new [=period=] must be started in order to establish a new sample timeline.

A sample timeline SHALL be shared by all [=representations=] in the same [=adaptation set=]. [=Representations=] in different [=adaptation sets=] MAY use different sample timelines.

The sample timeline is measured in <dfn>timescale units</dfn> defined as a number of units per second. This value SHALL be present in the MPD as `SegmentTemplate@timescale` or `SegmentBase@timescale` (depending on the [=addressing mode=]).

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/PresentationTimeOffset.png" />
	<figcaption>`@presentationTimeOffset` is the key component in establishing the relationship between the [=MPD timeline=] and a sample timeline.</figcaption>
</figure>

`@presentationTimeOffset` is a point on a sample timeline which SHALL be considered equivalent to the [=period=] start point on the [=MPD timeline=]. The value is provided by `SegmentTemplate@presentationTimeOffset` or `SegmentBase@presentationTimeOffset`, depending on the [=addressing mode=], and has a default value of 0 `@timescale` units.

The relationship between a sample timeline and the [=MPD timeline=] is fully described by the combination of `@presentationTimeOffset`, `@timescale` and `Period@start`.

Note: To transform a [=sample timeline=] position `SampleTime` to an [=MPD timeline=] position, use the formula `MpdTime = Period@start + (SampleTime - @presentationTimeOffset) / @timescale`.

`@presentationTimeOffset` SHALL NOT change between updates of a dynamic MPD.

## Media segments ## {#timing-mediasegment}

A <dfn>media segment</dfn> is an HTTP-addressable data structure that contains one or more media samples.

[=Media segments=] SHALL contain one or more consecutive media samples. Consecutive [=media segments=] in the same [=representation=] SHALL contain consecutive media samples.

[=Media segments=] SHALL contain the media samples that exactly match the time span on the [=sample timeline=] that is assigned to the [=media segment=] by the MPD, except when using [=simple addressing=] in which case a certain amount of inaccuracy MAY be present as defined in [[#timing-addressing-inaccuracy]].

Advisement: Even when using [=simple addressing=], the [=media segment=] that starts at or overlaps the [=period=] start point SHALL contain a media sample that starts at or overlaps the [=period=] start point and the [=media segment=] that ends at or overlaps the [=period=] end point SHALL contain a media sample that ends at or overlaps the [=period=] end point.

## Segment addressing modes ## {#timing-addressing}

This section defines the <dfn title="addressing mode">addressing modes</dfn> that can be used for referencing [=media segments=] and [=initialization segments=] in interopreable DASH presentations.

Addressing modes not defined in this chapter SHALL NOT be used by DASH services. Clients SHOULD support all addressing modes defined in this chapter.

A service SHOULD choose the addressing mode based on the nature of the content:

<dl class="switch">

: Content generated on the fly
:: Use [=explicit addressing=].

: Content generated in advance of publishing
:: Use [=explicit addressing=] or [=indexed addressing=].

</dl>

A service MAY use [=simple addressing=] which enables the packager logic to be very simple. This simplicity comes at a cost of reduced applicability to multi-period scenarios and reduced client compatibility.

All [=representations=] in the same [=adaptation set=] SHALL use the same addressing mode. [=Representations=] in different [=adaptation sets=] MAY use different addressing modes.

### Indexed addressing ### {#timing-addressing-indexed}

A representation that uses <dfn>indexed addressing</dfn> consists of an [=ISO BMFF=] track file containing an index segment, an [=initialization segment=] and a sequence of [=media segments=].

Clauses in section only apply to [=representations=] that use indexed addressing.

Note: [[MPEGDASH]] makes a distinction between "segment" (HTTP-addressable entity) and "subsegment" (byte range of an HTTP-addressable entity). This document does not make such a distinction and has no concept of subsegments.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/IndexedAddressing.png" />
	<figcaption>Indexed addressing is based on an index segment that references all [=media segments=].</figcaption>
</figure>

The period defines the byte range of the track file that contains the index segment. The index segment informs the client of all the [=media segments=] that exist, the time spans they cover on the [=sample timeline=] and their byte ranges.

Multiple representations SHALL NOT be stored in the same track file.

At least one `Representation/BaseURL` element SHALL be present in the period and SHALL contain a reference to the track file. See [[#timing-urls-and-http]] for details on URL handling.

The `SegmentBase@indexRange` attribute SHALL be present in the period and SHALL reference the byte range of the segment index in the track file. The value SHALL be formatted as a `byte-range-spec` as defined in [[!RFC7233]], referencing a single range of bytes.

The `SegmentBase@timescale` attribute SHALL be present and its value SHALL match the value of the `timescale` field in the index segment.

The `AdaptationSet@subsegmentStartsWithSAP` attribute SHALL be present in the period and SHALL have a value of `1` or `2`, depending on the sample structure of the [=media segments=].

Issue: We need to clarify how to determine the right value. [#235](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/DASH-IF-IOP/issues/235)

The `SegmentBase/Initialization@range` attribute SHALL reference the byte range of the [=initialization segment=] in the track file. The value SHALL be formatted as a `byte-range-spec` as defined in [[!RFC7233]], referencing a single range of bytes. The `Initialization@sourceURL` attribute SHALL NOT be used.

<div class="example">
Below is an example of common usage of the indexed addressing mode.

The example defines a timescale of 48000 units per second, with the period starting at position 8100 (or 0.16875 seconds) on the [=sample timeline=]. The client can use the index segment referenced by `indexRange` to determine where the [=media segment=] containing position 8100 (and all other [=media segments=]) can be found. The byte range of the [=initialization segment=] is also referenced.

<xmp highlight="xml">
<MPD xmlns="urn:mpeg:dash:schema:mpd:2011">
	<Period>
		<AdaptationSet subsegmentStartsWithSAP="1">
			<Representation>
				<BaseURL>showreel_audio_dashinit.mp4</BaseURL>
				<SegmentBase timescale="48000" presentationTimeOffset="8100" indexRange="848-999">
					<Initialization range="0-847"/>
				</SegmentBase>
			</Representation>
		</AdaptationSet>
	</Period>
</MPD>
</xmp>

Parts of the MPD structure that are not relevant for this chapter have been omitted - this is not a fully functional MPD file.
</div>

#### Structure of the index segment #### {#timing-addressing-indexed-indexstructure}

The index segment SHALL consist of a single Segment Index Box (`sidx`) as defined by [[!ISOBMFF]]. The field layout is as follows:

<xmp>
aligned(8) class SegmentIndexBox extends FullBox('sidx', version, 0) {
	unsigned int(32) reference_ID;
	unsigned int(32) timescale;

	if (version==0) {
		unsigned int(32) earliest_presentation_time;
		unsigned int(32) first_offset;
	}
	else {
		unsigned int(64) earliest_presentation_time;
		unsigned int(64) first_offset;
	}

	unsigned int(16) reserved = 0;
	unsigned int(16) reference_count;

	for (i = 1; i <= reference_count; i++)
	{
		bit (1)              reference_type;
		unsigned int(31)     referenced_size;
		unsigned int(32)     subsegment_duration;
		bit(1)               starts_with_SAP;
		unsigned int(3)      SAP_type;
		unsigned int(28)     SAP_delta_time;
	}
}
</xmp>

The values of the fields SHALL be as follows:

: `reference_ID`
:: The `track_ID` of the track that contains the data of this [=representation=].

: `timescale`
:: Same as the `timescale` field of the Media Header Box and same as the `SegmentBase@timescale` attribute in the MPD.

: `earliest_presentation_time`
:: The start timestamp of the first [=media segment=] on the [=sample timeline=], in [=timescale units=].

: `first_offset`
:: Distance from the anchor point to the first [=media segment=].

: `reference_count`
:: Total number of [=media segments=] referenced by the index segment.

: `reference_type`
:: `0`

: `referenced_size`
:: Size of the [=media segment=] in bytes. [=Media segments=] are assumed to be consecutive, so this is also the distance to the start of the next [=media segment=].

: `subsegment_duration`
:: Duration of the [=media segment=] in [=timescale units=].

: `starts_with_SAP`
:: `1`

: `SAP_type`
:: Either `1` or `2`, depending on the sample structure in the [=media segment=].

: `SAP_delta_time`
:: `0`

Issue: BMFF mentions edit lists when talking of this box, whereas IOP does not. Do we need to mention edit lists? Are they intentionally omitted from IOP?

#### Moving the period start point (indexed addressing) #### {#timing-addressing-indexed-startpoint}

When splitting periods in two or performing other types of editorial timing adjustments, a service might want to start a period at a point after the "natural" start point of the [=representations=] within.

For [=representations=] that use [=indexed addressing=], perform the following adjustments to set a new [=period=] start point:

1. Update `SegmentBase@presentationTimeOffset` to indicate the desired start point on the [=sample timeline=].
1. Update `Period@duration` to match the new duration.

### Explicit addressing ### {#timing-addressing-explicit}

A representation that uses <dfn>explicit addressing</dfn> consists of a set of [=media segments=] accessed via URLs constructed using a template defined in the MPD, with the exact time span covered by each [=media segment=] described in the MPD.

Clauses in section only apply to [=representations=] that use explicit addressing.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/ExplicitAddressing.png" />
	<figcaption>Explicit addressing uses a segment template that is combined with explicitly defined time spans for each [=media segment=] in order to reference [=media segments=].</figcaption>
</figure>

The MPD SHALL contain a `SegmentTemplate/SegmentTimeline` element that contains a set of [=segment references=] which satisfies the requirements defined in this document. The references exist as a sequence of `S` elements, each of which references one or more [=media segments=] with start time `S@t` and duration `S@d` in `SegmentTemplate@timescale` units on the [=sample timeline=]. The `SegmentTemplate@duration` attribute SHALL NOT be present.

To enable concise reference definitions, an `S` element may be a repeating [=segment reference=] that indicates a number of repeated consecutive [=media segments=] with the same duration. The value of `S@r` SHALL indicate the number of additional consecutive [=media segments=] that exist.

Note: Only additional references are counted, so `S@r=5` indicates a total of 6 consecutive [=media segments=] with the same duration.

The start time of a [=media segment=] SHALL be calculated from the start time and duration of the previous [=media segment=] if not specified by `S@t`. There SHALL NOT be any gaps or overlap between [=media segments=].

The value of `S@r` SHALL be nonnegative, except for the last `S` element which MAY have a negative value in `S@r`, indicating that the repeated references continue indefinitely up to a [=media segment=] that either ends at or overlaps the period end point.

[[#timing-mpd-updates|Updates to a dynamic MPD]] MAY add more `S` elements, remove expired `S` elements or increase the value of `S@r` on the last `S` element but SHALL NOT otherwise modify existing `S` elements.

The `SegmentTemplate@media` attribute SHALL contain the URL template for referencing [=media segments=]. The `SegmentTemplate@initialization` attribute SHALL contain the URL template for referencing [=initialization segments=]. URL construction rules are defined in [[#timing-urls-and-http]].

<div class="example">
Below is an example of common usage of the explicit addressing mode.

The example defines 225 [=media segments=] starting at position 900 on the [=sample timeline=] and lasting for a total of 900.225 seconds. The period ends at 900 seconds, so the last 0.225 seconds of content is clipped (out of bounds samples may also simply be omitted from the last [=media segment=]). The [=period=] starts at position 900 which matches the start position of the first [=media segment=] found at the relative URL `video/900.m4s`.

The example defines a sequence of 11 [=media segments=] starting at position 120 on the [=sample timeline=] and lasting for a total of 95520 units at a timescale of 1000 units per second (which results in 95.52 seconds of data). The [=period=] starts at position 810, which is within the first [=media segment=], found at the relative URL `video/120.m4s`.

#### Moving the period start point (explicit addressing) #### {#timing-addressing-explicit-startpoint}

When splitting periods in two or performing other types of editorial timing adjustments, a service might want to start a period at a point after the "natural" start point of the [=representations=] within.

For [=representations=] that use [=explicit addressing=], perform the following adjustments to set a new [=period=] start point:

<div class="algorithm">

1. Update `SegmentTemplate@presentationTimeOffset` to indicate the desired start point on the [=sample timeline=].
1. Update `Period@duration` to match the new duration.
1. Remove any unnecessary segment references.

</div>

Note: See [[#timing-representation]] and [[#timing-mpd-updates-remove-content]] to understand the constraints that apply to [=segment reference=] removal.

### Simple addressing ### {#timing-addressing-simple}

A representation that uses <dfn>simple addressing</dfn> consists of a set of [=media segments=] accessed via URLs constructed using a template defined in the MPD, with the nominal time span covered by each [=media segment=] described in the MPD.

Advisement: Simple addressing defines the nominal time span of each [=media segment=] in the MPD. The true time span covered by samples within the [=media segment=] can be slightly different than the nominal time span. See [[#timing-addressing-inaccuracy]].

Clauses in section only apply to [=representations=] that use simple addressing.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/SimpleAddressing.png" />
	<figcaption>Simple addressing uses a segment template that is combined with approximate first [=media segment=] timing information and an average [=media segment=] duration in order to reference [=media segments=].</figcaption>
</figure>

The `SegmentTemplate@duration` attribute SHALL define the nominal duration of a [=media segment=] in [=timescale units=]. The average true duration of [=media segments=] SHALL match the nominal duration.

The set of [=segment references=] SHALL consist of the first [=media segment=] starting exactly at the [=period=] start point and all other [=media segments=] following in a consecutive series of equal time spans of `SegmentTemplate@duration` [=timescale units=], ending with a [=media segment=] that ends at or overlaps the [=period=] end time.

The `SegmentTemplate@media` attribute SHALL contain the URL template for referencing [=media segments=]. The `SegmentTemplate@initialization` attribute SHALL contain the URL template for referencing [=initialization segments=]. URL construction rules are defined in [[#timing-urls-and-http]].

<div class="example">
Below is an example of common usage of the simple addressing mode.

The example defines a [=sample timeline=] with a timescale of 1000 units per second, with the [=period=] starting at position 900. The average duration of a [=media segment=] is 4001. [=Media segment=] numbering starts at 800, so the first [=media segment=] is found at the relative URL `video/800.m4s`. The sequence of [=media segments=] continues to the end of the period, which is 900 seconds long, making for a total of 225 defined [=segment references=].

#### Inaccuracy in media segment timing when using simple addressing #### {#timing-addressing-inaccuracy}

When using [=simple addressing=], the samples contained in a [=media segment=] MAY cover a different time span on the [=sample timeline=] than what is indicated by the nominal timing in the MPD, as long as no constraints defined in this document are violated by this deviation.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/InaccurateAddressing.png" />
	<figcaption>Simple addressing relaxes the requirement on [=media segment=] contents matching the [=sample timeline=]. Red boxes indicate samples.</figcaption>
</figure>

The allowed deviation is defined as the maximum offset between the edges of the nominal time span (as defined by the MPD) and the edges of the true time span (as defined by the contents of the [=media segment=]). The deviation is evaluated separately for each edge.

Advisement: This allowed deviation does not relax any requirements that do not explicitly define an exception. For example, [=periods=] must still be covered with samples for their entire duration, which constrains the flexibility allowed for the first and last [=media segment=] in a [=period=].

The deviation SHALL be no more than 50% of the nominal [=media segment=] duration and MAY be in either direction.

Note: This results in a maximum true duration of 200% (+50% outward extension on both edges) and a minimum segment duration of 1 sample (-50% inward from both edges would result in 0 but empty segments are not allowed).

Allowing inaccurate timing is intended to enable reasoning on the [=sample timeline=] using average values for [=media segment=] timing. If the addressing data says that a [=media segment=] contains 4 seconds of data on average, a client can predict with reasonable accuracy which samples are found in which [=media segments=], while at the same time the service is not required to publish per-segment timing data in the MPD. It is expected that the content is packaged with this contraint in mind (i.e. **every** segment cannot be inaccurate in the same direction - a shorter segment now implies a longer segment in the future to make up for it).

<div class="example">
Consider a [=media segment=] with a nominal start time of 10 seconds from period start and a nominal duration of 4 seconds, within a [=period=] of unlimited duration.

The following are all valid contents for such a [=media segment=]:

* samples from 10 to 14 seconds (perfect accuracy)
* samples from 8 to 16 seconds (maximally large segment allowed by drift tolerance, 50% increase from both ends)
* samples from 11.9 to 12 seconds (near-minimally small segment; while drift tolerance allows 50% decrease from both ends, resulting in zero duration, every segment must still contain at least one sample)
* samples from 8 to 12 seconds (maximal drift toward [=zero point=] at both ends)
* samples from 12 to 16 seconds (maximal drift away from [=zero point=] at both ends)

Near [=period=] boundaries, all the constraints of timing and addressing must still be respected. Consider a [=media segment=] with a nominal start time of 0 seconds from [=period=] start and a nominal duration of 4 seconds.

If such a [=media segment=] contained samples from 1 to 5 seconds (drift of 1 second away from [=zero point=] at both ends, which is within acceptable limits) it would be non-conforming because of the requirement in [[#timing-mediasegment]] that the first [=media segment=] contain a media sample that starts at or overlaps the [=period=] start point.
</div>

#### Moving the period start point (simple addressing) #### {#timing-addressing-simple-startpoint}

When splitting periods in two or performing other types of editorial timing adjustments, a service might want to start a period at a point after the "natural" start point of the [=representations=] within.

[=Simple addressing=] is challenging to use in such scenarios. You SHOULD convert [=simple addressing=] representations to use [=explicit addressing=] before adjusting the [=period=] start point or splitting a [=period=]. See [[#timing-addressing-simple-to-explicit]].

The rest of this chapter provides instructions for situations where you choose <em>not</em> to convert to [=explicit addressing=].

To move the period start point, for [=representations=] that use [=simple addressing=]:

* Every [=simple addressing=] [=representation=] in the [=period=] must contain a [=media segment=] that starts at the new period start point.
* [=Media segments=] starting at the new period start point must contain a sample that starts at or overlaps the new period start point.

Note: If you are splitting a [=period=], also keep in mind [[#timing-mediasegment|the requirements on period end point sample alignment]] for the [=period=] that remains before the split point.

Finding a suitable new start point that conforms to the above requirements can be very difficult. If inaccurate timing is used, it may be altogether impossible. This is a limitation of [=simple addressing=].

Having ensured conformance to the above requirements for the new period start point, perform the following adjustments:

<div class="algorithm">

1. Update `SegmentTemplate@presentationTimeOffset` to indicate the desired start point on the [=sample timeline=].
1. Increment `SegmentTemplate@startNumber` by the number of [=media segments=] between the old and new start point.
1. Update `Period@duration` to match the new duration.

</div>

#### Converting simple addressing to explicit addressing #### {#timing-addressing-simple-to-explicit}

Advisement: [=Simple addressing=] allows for inaccuracy in [=media segment=] timing. No inaccuracy is allowed by [=explicit addressing=]. The mechanism of conversion described here only applies when there is no inaccuracy. If the nominal time spans in original the MPD differ from the true time spans of the [=media segments=], re-package the content from scratch using [=explicit addressing=] instead of converting.

To perform the conversion, execute the following steps:

<div class="algorithm">

1. Calculate the number of [=media segments=] in the representation as `SegmentCount = Ceil(AsSeconds(Period@duration) / ( SegmentTemplate@duration / SegmentTemplate@timescale))`.
1. Assign a zero-based `SegmentIndex` value to each [=media segment=] in the representation, incrementing by one per segment.
1. If using `$Number$` placeholders in `SegmentTemplate@media`:
	1. Replace `$Number$` placeholders with equivalent `$Time$` placeholders.
	1. Rename segment files to match new template. Calculate the value for `$Time$` as `SegmentStartTime = SegmentTemplate@presentationTimeOffset + SegmentIndex * SegmentTemplate@duration`.
1. Update the MPD.
	1. Remove `SegmentTemplate@startNumber` if present.
	1. Add a single `SegmentTemplate/SegmentTimeline` element.
	1. Add a single `SegmentTimeline/S` element.
	1. Set `S@t` to equal `SegmentTemplate@presentationTimeOffset`.
	1. Set `S@d` to equal `SegmentTemplate@duration`.
	1. Remove `SegmentTemplate@duration`.
	1. Set `S@r` to `SegmentCount - 1`.

</div>

<div class="example">
Below is an example of a [=simple addressing=] [=representation=] before conversion.

<xmp highlight="xml">
<MPD xmlns="urn:mpeg:dash:schema:mpd:2011">
	<Period duration="PT900S">
		<AdaptationSet>
			<Representation>
				<SegmentTemplate timescale="1000" presentationTimeOffset="900"
						media="video/$Number$.m4s" initialization="video/init.mp4"
						duration="4001" startNumber="800" />
			</Representation>
		</AdaptationSet>
	</Period>
</MPD>
</xmp>

As part of the conversion, we calculate `SegmentCount = Ceil(900 / (4001 / 1000)) = 225`. We also rename files to time-based addressing, with the first segment file `800.m4s` getting the value `SegmentStartTime = 900 + 0 * 4001 = 900` which will later be resolved to the path `video/900.m4s` by clients.

After conversion, we arrive at the following result.

<xmp highlight="xml">
<MPD xmlns="urn:mpeg:dash:schema:mpd:2011">
	<Period duration="PT900S">
		<AdaptationSet>
			<Representation>
				<SegmentTemplate timescale="1000" presentationTimeOffset="900"
						media="video/$Time$.m4s" initialization="video/init.mp4">
					<SegmentTimeline>
						<S t="900" d="4001" r="224" />
					</SegmentTimeline>
				</SegmentTemplate>
			</Representation>
		</AdaptationSet>
	</Period>
</MPD>
</xmp>

Parts of the MPD structure that are not relevant for this chapter have been omitted - the above are not fully functional MPD files.
</div>

## Resolving URLs and performing HTTP requests ## {#timing-urls-and-http}

Issue: Determine appropriate content for this section.

## Segment alignment ## {#timing-segmentalignment}

[=Media segments=] are said to be aligned if the start/end points of all [=media segments=] on the [=sample timeline=] are equal in all [=representations=] that belong to the same [=adaptation set=].

[=Media segments=] SHALL be aligned. When using [=simple addressing=] or [=explicit addressing=], this means `AdaptationSet@segmentAlignment=true` in the MPD. When using [=indexed addressing=], this means `AdaptationSet@subsegmentAlignment=true` in the MPD.

Equivalent aligned [=media segments=] in different [=representations=] SHALL contain samples for the same true time span, even if using [=simple addressing=] with [[#timing-addressing-inaccuracy|inaccurate media segment timing]].

## Period connectivity ## {#timing-connectivity}

In certain circumstances content may be offered such that a [=representation=] is technically compatible with the content of a [=representation=] in a previous [=period=]. Such [=representations=] are <dfn>period-connected</dfn>.

[=Initialization segments=] of period-connected [=representations=] SHALL be functionally equivalent (i.e. the [=initialization segment=] from any period-connected [=representation=] can be used to initialize playback of any period-connected [=representation=]).

Note: Connectivity is generally achieved by using the same encoder to encode the content of multiple [=periods=] using the same settings. Keep in mind, however, that decryption is also a part of the client media pipeline - it is not only the codec parameters that are configured by the [=initialization segment=].

Such content SHOULD be signaled in the MPD as period-connected. This is expected to help clients ensure seamless playback across [=period=] transitions. Any subset of the [=representations=] in a [=period=] MAY be period-connected with their counterparts in a future or past [=period=]. Period connectivity MAY be chained across any number of [=periods=].

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/PeriodConnectivity.png" />
	<figcaption>[=Representations=] can be signaled as period connected, enabling client optimizations. Arrows on diagram indicate direction of connectivity reference (from future to past), with the implied message being "the client can use the same decoder it used where the arrow points to".</figcaption>
</figure>

An MPD MAY contain unrelated [=periods=] between [=periods=] that contain period-connected [=representations=].

The [=sample timelines=] of period-connected [=representations=] MAY be mutually discontinuous (e.g. due to skipping some content, encoder clock wrap-around or editorial decisions).

The following signaling SHALL be used to identify period-connected [=representations=] across two [=periods=]:

* `Representation@id` is equal.
* `AdaptationSet@id` is equal.
* The [=adaptation set=] in the second [=period=] has a supplemental property with:
	* `@shemeIdUri` set to `urn:mpeg:dash:period-connectivity:2015`.
	* `@value` set to the `Period@id` of the first period.

Note: Not all [=representations=] in an [=adaptation set=] need to be period-connected. For example, if a new [=period=] is introduced to add a [=representation=] that contains a new video quality level, all other [=representations=] will likely be connected but not the one that was added.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/SegmentOverlapOnPeriodConnectivity.png" />
	<figcaption>The same [=media segment=] will often exist in two periods at a period-connected transition. On the diagram, this is segment 4.</figcaption>
</figure>

As a [=period=] may start and/or end in the middle of a [=media segment=], the same [=media segment=] MAY simultaneously exist in two period-connected [=representations=], with one part of it scheduled for playback during the first [=period=] and the other part during the second [=period=]. This is likely to be the case when no [=sample timeline=] discontinuity is introduced by the transition.

Clients SHOULD NOT present a [=media segment=] twice when it occurs on both sides of a period transition in a period-connected [=representation=].

Clients SHOULD ensure seamless playback of period-connected [=representations=] in consecutive [=periods=].

Note: The exact mechanism that ensures seamless playback depends on client capabilities and will be implementation-specific. Any shared [=media segment=] overlapping the [=period=] boundary may need to be detected and deduplicated to avoid presenting it twice.

### Period continuity ### {#timing-connectivity-continuity}

In addition to [[#timing-connectivity|period connectivity]], [[!MPEGDASH]] defines period continuity, which is a special case of period connectivity where the two samples on the boundary between the connected [=representations=] are consecutive on the same [=sample timeline=].

Note: The above can only be true if the sample boundary exactly matches the period boundary.

Period continuity MAY be signaled in the MPD when the above condition is met, in which case period connectivity SHALL NOT be simultaneously signaled on the same [=representation=]. Continuity implies connectivity.

The signaling of period continuity is the same as for [[#timing-connectivity|period connectivity]], except that the value to use for `@schemeIdUri` is `urn:mpeg:dash:period-continuity:2015`.

Clients MAY take advantage of any platform-specific optimizations for seamless playback that knowledge of period continuity enables; beyond that, clients SHALL treat continuity the same as connectivity.

## Dynamic MPDs ## {#timing-dynamic}

This section only applies to dynamic MPDs.

Advisement: A dynamic MPD must conform to the constraints in this document not only at its moment of initial publishing but through the entire validity duration of the MPD (as defined by `MPD@minimumUpdatePeriod`).

## Real time clock synchronization ## {#timing-sync}

A dynamic MPD SHALL include at least one `UTCTiming` element that defines a clock synchronization mechanism.

A client presenting a dynamic MPD SHALL synchronize its local clock according to the `UTCTiming` elements in the MPD and SHALL emit a warning or error to application developers when clock synchronization fails or `UTCTiming` elements are not available. A client SHALL NOT assume that clocks are synchronized using some default mechanism.

Issue: Describe the relevant mechanisms.

### Availability ### {#timing-availability}

A segment is <dfn>available</dfn> if an HTTP request to acquire it can be successfully performed to completion by a client. In a dynamic MPD, new [=media segments=] continuously become available and stop being available with the passage of time.

The <dfn>availability window</dfn> is the time span on a [=sample timeline=] that determines which [=media segments=] are available. Each [=sample timeline=] has its own availability window.

The availability window is calculated as follows:

<div class="algorithm">

1. Let <var>now</var> be the current time according to [[#timing-sync|the synchronized clock]].
1. Let <var>TotalAvailabilityTimeOffset</var> be the sum of all `@availabilityTimeOffset` values that apply to the [=representation=] (those on the relevant `Representation` element and any of its ancestors).
1. Let <var>AvailabilityWindowStart</var> be <var>now</var> - `MPD@timeShiftBufferDepth`.
1. Let <var>AvailabilityWindowEnd</var> be <var>now</var> + <var>TotalAvailabilityTimeOffset</var>.
1. The availability window is the time span from <var>AvailabilityWindowStart</var> to <var>AvailabilityWindowEnd</var>.

</div>

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/AvailabilityWindow.png" />
	<figcaption>The availability window determines which [=media segments=] are available, based on where their end point lies.</figcaption>
</figure>

A service SHALL ensure that all [=media segments=] that have an <em>end point</em> inside or at the end of the availability window are available.

Advisement: It is the responsibility of the service to ensure that [=media segments=] are available to clients when they are described as available by the MPD. To define proper availability timing, one must consider the entire publishing flow through the CDN, not only when the origin server makes data available to the CDN.

Clients MAY attempt to acquire any available [=media segment=]. Clients SHALL NOT attempt to acquire [=media segments=] that are not available.

Clients SHOULD NOT assume that [=media segments=] described by the MPD as available are always available at the correct moment in time and SHOULD implement appropriate retry behavior.

## Time shift window ## {#timing-timeshift}

Due to various delays and processes required to create and publish [=media segments=], it will often be the case that [=media segments=] become [=available=] with some delay, both with regard to the expected scheduling and with regard to differences between [=representations=]. The mechanism for signaling the expected delay is `MPD@suggestedPresentationDelay`.

Note: The most obvious delay is that a [=media segment=] only becomes available once its end point enters the [=availability window=]. [=Representations=] with different [=media segment=] durations are going to have different delays due to this factor. `@availabilityTimeOffset` counters this factor, signaling availability ahead of schedule.

The <dfn>time shift window</dfn> is a time span on the [=MPD timeline=] that indicates content that a client may present at the current moment in time.

Let <var>now</var> be the current time according to [[#timing-sync|the synchronized clock]]. The time shift window starts at <var>now</var> - `MPD@timeShiftBufferDepth` and ends at <var>now</var> - `MPD@suggestedPresentationDelay`.

Note: The start point of the [=availability window=] and time shift window are always equal. The end points are equal if there is no `@availabiltiyTimeOffset` or `MPD@suggestedPresentationDelay`.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/TimeShiftWindow.png" />
	<figcaption>Samples overlapping the time shift window may be presented by a client.</figcaption>
</figure>

Services SHALL provide a suitable value for `MPD@suggestedPresentationDelay` to ensure that [=media segments=] that overlap the [=time shift window=] are [=available=].

Note: If this value is zero, the service needs to signal a sufficiently extended [=availability window=] using `@availabilityTimeOffset` to ensure that all [=media segments=] are [=available=] when they overlap with the [=time shift window=].

Clients MAY present any samples that are entirely inside the time shift window. Clients SHALL NOT present any samples that are entirely outside the time shift window (whether in the past or the future).

### MPD updates ### {#timing-mpd-updates}

Dynamic MPDs MAY change over time. The nature of the change is not restricted unless such a restriction is explicitly defined.

Some common reasons to make changes in dynamic MPDs:

* Adding new [=segment references=] to an existing [=period=].
* Adding new [=periods=].
* Converting unlimited-duration [=periods=] to fixed-duration [=periods=] by adding `Period@duration`.
* Removing [=segment references=] and/or [=periods=] that have fallen out of the [=time shift window=].
* Shortening an existing [=period=] when changes in content scheduling take place.
* Adding `MPD@mediaPresentationDuration` to signal that the timeline of the MPD will no longer be extended with new [=periods=].
* Removing `MPD@minimumUpdatePeriod` to signal that MPD will no longer be updated (even though it may remain a dynamic MPD).
* Converting the MPD to a static MPD to signal that a live service has become available on-demand as a recording.

The following basic restrictions are defined here for MPD updates:

* `MPD@id` SHALL NOT change.
* `MPD@availabilityStartTime` SHALL NOT change.
* `Period@id` SHALL NOT change.
* `Period@start` SHALL NOT change.
* `Period@duration` SHALL NOT change except when explicitly allowed by other statements in this document.
* The [=adaptation sets=] present in a [=period=] (i.e. the set of `AdaptationSet@id` values) SHALL NOT change.
* The [=representations=] present in an [=adaptation set=] (i.e. the set of `Representation@id` values) SHALL NOT change.
* The functional behavior of a [=representation=] (identified by a matching `Representation@id` value) SHALL NOT change, neither in terms of metadata-driven behavior (including metadata inherited from [=adaptation set=] level) nor in terms of [=media segment=] timing. In particular:
	* `SegmentTemplate@presentationTimeOffset` SHALL NOT change.
	* `SegmentTemplate@startNumber` SHALL NOT change.
	* `SegmentBase@presentationTimeOffset` SHALL NOT change.

Advisement: Additional restrictions on MPD updates are defined by other parts of this document.

Clients SHOULD use `@id` to track [=period=], [=adaptation set=] and [=representation=] identity across MPD updates.

The presence or absence of `MPD@minimumUpdatePeriod` SHALL be used to signal whether the MPD might be updated (with presence indicating potential for future updates). The value of this field indicates the maximum duration between MPD refreshes by the client. In other words, this is the validity duration of the present state of the MPD.

Note: In practice, clients will also require some time to download and process an MPD update - a service should not assume perfect update timing. Conversely, a client should not assume that it can get all updates in time (it may already be attempting to buffer some [=media segments=] that were removed by an MPD update).

If `MPD@minimumUpdatePeriod` is absent then `MPD@mediaPresentationDuration` SHALL be present. Both attributes MAY be present simultaneously to signal that the MPD might still receive updates but these updates will not introduce new [=periods=].

In addition to signaling that clients are expected to poll for regular MPD updates, a service MAY publish in-band events to schedule MPD updates at moments of its choosing.

#### Adding content to the MPD #### {#timing-mpd-updates-add-content}

There are two mechanisms for adding content:

* Additional [=segment references=] MAY be added to the last [=period=].
* Additional [=periods=] MAY be added to the end of the MPD.

Multiple content adding mechanisms MAY be combined in a single MPD update.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/MpdUpdate - AddContent.png" />
	<figcaption>MPD updates can add both [=segment references=] and [=periods=] (additions highlighted in blue).</figcaption>
</figure>

[=Segment references=] SHALL NOT be added to any [=period=] other than the last [=period=]. An MPD update MAY combine adding [=segment references=] to the last period with adding of new [=periods=].

Note: The duration of the last [=period=] cannot change as a result of adding [=segment references=]. A live service will generally use a [=period=] with an unlimited duration to continuously add new references.

When using [=simple addressing=] or [=explicit addressing=], it is possible for a period to define an infinite sequence of [=segment references=] that extends to the end of the [=period=] (e.g. using `SegmentTemplate@duration` or `r="-1"`). Such self-extending reference sequences SHALL be considered equivalent to explicitly defined reference sequences that extend to the end of the [=period=] and clients MAY obtain new references from such sequences even between MPD updates.

An MPD update that adds content MAY be combined [[#timing-mpd-updates-remove-content|with an MPD update that removes content]].

#### Removing content from the MPD #### {#timing-mpd-updates-remove-content}

Removal of content is only allowed if the content to be removed is not yet [=available=] to clients and will not become [=available=] until clients receive the MPD update. See [[#timing-availability]].

Let <var>EarliestRemovalPoint</var> be <var>AvailabilityWindowEnd</var> + `MPD@minimumUpdatePeriod`. [=Media segments=] that overlap or end before <var>EarliestRemovalPoint</var> might be considered by clients to be [=available=] at the time the MPD update is processed.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/MpdUpdate - RemoveContent.png" />
	<figcaption>MPD updates can remove both [=segment references=] and [=periods=] (removals highlighted in red).</figcaption>
</figure>

An MPD update removing content MAY remove any [=segment references=] to [=media segments=] that start after <var>EarliestRemovalPoint</var> at the time the update is published but SHALL NOT remove any other [=segment references=].

An MPD update removing content SHALL NOT leave <var>EarliestRemovalPoint</var> outside the time span of all [=periods=] unless this point is beyond the end of a fixed-duration MPD (`MPD@availabilityStartTime + MPD@mediaPresentationDuration`).

The following mechanisms exist removing content:

* The last [=period=] MAY change from unlimited duration to fixed duration.
* The duration of the last [=period=] MAY be shortened.
* One or more [=periods=] MAY be removed entirely from the end of the MPD.

Multiple content removal mechanisms MAY be combined in a single MPD update.

The above mechanisms can be used in any extent as long as no constraints defined in this document are violated. In particular, consider the constraints on invalidating [=segment references=] defined in this chapter.

Clients SHALL NOT fail catastrophically if an MPD update removes already buffered data but MAY incur unexpected time shift or a visible transition at the point of removal. It is the responsibility of the service to avoid removing data that may already be in use.

In addition to editorial removal from the end of the MPD, content naturally expires due to the passage of time. Expired content also needs to be removed:

* Explicitly defined [=segment references=] (`S` elements) SHALL be removed when they have expired (i.e. the [=media segment=] end point has fallen out of the [=time shift window=]).
	* A repeating explicit [=segment reference=] (`S` element with `@r != 0`) SHALL NOT be removed until all repetitions have expired.
* Expired periods (i.e. those with no remaining [=segment references=]) SHALL be removed.

Note: When using [=indexed addressing=] or [=simple addressing=], removal of [=segment references=] only requires changing `Period@duration`.

An MPD update that removes content MAY be combined [[#timing-mpd-updates-add-content|with an MPD update that adds content]].

## Forbidden techniques ## {#timing-nonos}

Some aspects of [[!MPEGDASH]] are not compatible with the interoperable timing model defined in this document. In the interest of clarity, they are explicitly listed here:

* The `@presentationDuration` attribute SHALL NOT be used.

## Examples ## {#timing-examples}

This section is informative.

### Offer content with imperfectly aligned tracks ### {#timing-examples-not-same-length}

It may be that for various content processing workflow reasons, some tracks have a different duration from others. For example, the audio track might start a fraction of a second before the video track and end some time before the video track ends.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/NonequalLengthTracks - Initial.png" />
	<figcaption>Content with different track lengths, before packaging as DASH.</figcaption>
</figure>

You now have some choices to make in how you package these tracks into a DASH presentation that conforms to this document. Specifically, there exists the requirement that every [=representation=] must cover the entire [=period=] with media samples.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/NonequalLengthTracks - CutEverything.png" />
	<figcaption>Content may be cut (indicated in black) to equalize track lengths.</figcaption>
</figure>

The simplest option is to define a single [=period=] that contains [=representations=] resulting from cutting the content to match the shortest common time span, thereby covering the entire [=period=] with samples. Depending on the nature of the data that is removed, this may or may not be acceptable.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/NonequalLengthTracks - PadEverything.png" />
	<figcaption>Content may be padded (indicated in green) to equalize track lengths.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you wish to preserve track contents in their entirety, the most interoperable option is to add padding samples (e.g. silence or black frames) to all tracks to ensure that all [=representations=] have enough data to cover the entire [=period=] with samples. This may require customization of the encoding process, as the padding must match the codec configuration of the real content and might be impractical to add after the real content has already been encoded.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/NonequalLengthTracks - MakePeriods.png" />
	<figcaption>New periods may be started at any change in the set of available tracks.</figcaption>
</figure>

Another option that preserves track contents is to [[#timing-examples-splitperiod|split the content]] into multiple [=periods=] that each contain a different set of [=representations=], starting a new [=period=] whenever a track starts or ends. This enables you to ensure every [=representations=] covers its [=period=] with samples. The upside of this approach is that it can be done easily, requiring only manipulation of the MPD. The downside is that some clients may be unable to seamlessly play across every [=period=] transition.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/NonequalLengthTracks - Mix.png" />
	<figcaption>You may combine the different approaches, cutting in some places (black), padding in others (green) and defining multiple [=periods=] as needed.</figcaption>
</figure>

You may wish to combine the different approaches, depending on the track, to achieve the optimal result.

Some clients are known to fail when transitioning from a period with audio and video to a period with only one of these components. You should avoid such transitions unless you have exact knowledge of the capabilities of your clients.

### Split a period ### {#timing-examples-splitperiod}

There exist scenarios where you would wish to split a [=period=] in two. Common reasons would be:

* to insert an ad [=period=] in the middle of an existing [=period=].
* parameters of one [=adaptation set=] change (e.g. KID or display aspect ratio), requiring a new [=period=] to update signaling.
* some [=adaptation sets=] become available or unavailable (e.g. different languages).

This example shows how an existing [=period=] can be split in a way that clients capable of [[#timing-connectivity|seamless period-connected playback]] do not experience interruptions in playback among [=representations=] that are present both before and after the split.

Our starting point is a presentation with a single period that contains an audio [=representation=] with short samples and a video [=representation=] with slightly longer samples, so that [=media segment=] start points do not always overlap.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/SplitInTwoPeriods - Before.png" />
	<figcaption>Presentation with one period, before splitting. Blue is a segment, yellow is a sample. Duration in arbitrary units is listed on samples. Segment durations are taken to be the sum of sample durations. `presentationTimeOffset` may have any value - it is listed because will be referenced later.</figcaption>
</figure>

Note: [=Periods=] may be split at any point in time as long as both sides of the split remain in conformance to this document (e.g. each contains at least 1 [=media segment=]). Furthermore, period splitting does not require manipulation of the segments themselves, only manipulation of the MPD.

Let's split this period at position 220. This split occurs during segment 3 for both [=representations=] and during sample 8 and sample 5 of the audio and video [=representation=], respectively.

The mechanism that enables [=period=] splitting in the middle of a segment is the following:

* a [=media segment=] that overlaps a [=period=] boundary exists in both [=periods=].
* [=representations=] that are split are signaled in the MPD as [=period-connected=].
* a representation that is [=period-connected=] with a representation in a previous period [[#timing-connectivity|is marked with the period connectivity descriptor]].
* clients are expected to deduplicate boundary-overlapping [=media segments=] for [=representations=] on which [[#timing-connectivity|period connectivity]] is signaled, if necessary for seamless playback (implementation-specific).
* clients are expected to present only the samples that are within the bounds of the current [=period=] (may be limited by client platform capabilities).

After splitting the example presentation, we arrive at the following structure.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/SplitInTwoPeriods - After.png" />
	<figcaption>Presentation with two periods, after splitting. Audio segment 3 and video segment 3 are shared by both periods, with the connectivity signaling indicating that seamless playback with de-duplicating behavior is expected from clients.</figcaption>
</figure>

If [=indexed addressing=] is used, both periods will reference all segments as both periods will use the same unmodified index segment. Clients are expected to ignore [=media segments=] that fall outside the [=period=] bounds.

Advisement: [=Simple addressing=] has significant limitations on alignment at [=period=] start, making it unsuitable for some multi-period scenarios. See [[#timing-addressing-simple-startpoint]].

Other [=periods=] (e.g. ads) may be inserted between the two [=periods=] resulting from the split. This does not affect the addressing and timing of the two [=periods=].

### Change the default_KID ### {#timing-examples-defaultkid}

In encrypted content, the `default_KID` of a [=representation=] might need to be changed at certain points in time. Often, the changes are closely synchronized in different [=representations=].

To perform the `default_KID` change, start a new period on every change, treating each [=representation=] as an independently changing element. With proper signaling, clients can perform this change seamlessly.

Issue: What about period connectivity? [#238](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/DASH-IF-IOP/issues/238)

The same pattern can also be applied to other changes in [=representation=] configuration.

## Placeholder chapter ## {#placeholder-for-temporary-terms}

This chapter contains a set of terms that will exist in the IOP document but that do not exist in it yet. By defining these terms here, we enable references to be already inserted in existing text, simplifying the editing process.

* <dfn>adaptation set</dfn>
* <dfn>initialization segment</dfn>
* <dfn>ISO BMFF</dfn>

## Editorial notes ## {#editorial-notes}

Notes on merging IOP v4.3 content into this chapter:

* 1 - not relevant
* 2 - not relevant
* 3.1 - not relevant
* 3.2.1 - potentially merged, needs a 2nd pass later to be sure
* 3.2.2 - not relevant (some overlap with relevant chapters, nothing unique)
* 3.2.3 - merged
* 3.2.4 - not relevant
* 3.2.5 - not relevant
* 3.2.6 - not relevant
* 3.2.7 - partially merged/superseded
	* This PR currently misses the "availability" aspect of timing, describing only the "when to play what" aspect.
* 3.2.7.2 - TODO ("availability" aspect)
* 3.2.7.3 - TODO ("availability" aspect)
* 3.2.7.4 - not relevant (?), make a 2nd pass later to verify where to put this - sounds like a "MPD format" thing rather than "timing" but maybe timing chapter is nearest fit
* 3.2.8 - not relevant
* 3.2.9 - not relevant
* 3.2.10 - not relevant
* 3.2.11 - not relevant
	* this seems more "file format" level text; while timing-related, it seems very specific to BMFF internals to have a place in the timing chapter (where the general situation seems already sufficiently well described); review this after we have restructured the rest of the document, see where the best home for this information (or whatever part of this information we keep) is
* 3.2.12 Content Offering With Periods - merged
	* There is some implied period-continuity logic. This is excessive combinatorics to expect the player to do. Just signal it on the service with the descriptor. Omitted.
	* AssetIdentifier has some implied connectivity logic that seems needless. Omitted. See https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/DASH-IF-IOP/issues/215
* 3.2.13 - not relevant
* 3.2.14 - not relevant
* 3.2.15 - TODO (addressing and base URLs)

Needs review:
* 4.8 Robust Operation - needs review

General comments:

* Chapter 3 in v4.3 is largely a random pile of constraints. Some that were timing-relevant are merged here. Others were not. Needs thorough review to ensure that nothing got unexpectedly missed or duplicated.
* Some terms "defined" in the timing chapter should probably be defined elsewhere once we have more content migrated.
* Where does minBufferTime go? It needs a home and some nice illustrations.
* Where do we define the `lmsg` mechanism?
* "@subsegmentStartsWithSAP" is related to timing in some sense but in another sense it is just a question of segment/sample structure. Not sure if it fits into this chapter.
